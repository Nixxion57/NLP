    "The preprocess_and_filter function is designed to enhance the pre-processing of SpaCy documents by combining lemmatization and filtering based on linguistic characteristics. It removes stop words, punctuation, and non-alphabetic tokens while maintaining only those classified as nouns, verbs, or adjectives. This function is particularly useful for refining textual data in a way that retains essential linguistic information, ensuring that only meaningful words contribute to subsequent analyses. By employing this function on SpaCy documents, users can achieve cleaner and more focused text representations, conducive to various natural language processing tasks."
